### Current Functionality
- Reads in file specified by a single command line arg
  - Stores each index in the file into a 9x9 2D array
- Stores taken values in a bool array for each sector
- Functions to remove candidate from sector and/or row/col

#### Solving Algorithms
- If a Cell has a single candidate, solve for that Cell with that candidate
- If a Cell has a unique value in its row/col/sector, solve for that Cell with the unique value
